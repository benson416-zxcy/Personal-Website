                    <p>
                        Climate Action (SDG 13) is the United Nations’ call to take urgent steps to combat climate change and its impacts. It aims to strengthen resilience to climate hazards, integrate climate measures into policies, improve education and awareness, and mobilize funding for developing countries, including the $100 billion annual goal under the Paris Agreement. Climate action is essential for sustainable development as climate change threatens ecosystems, economies, and livelihoods worldwide. By fostering global partnerships, supporting renewable energy, and implementing effective policies, SDG 13 seeks to mitigate climate impacts and build a sustainable future for all.</p>

                    <p>
                        Climate change is primarily driven by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, industrial processes, and agriculture, which release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere, trapping heat and warming the planet. Land use changes, such as urbanization and deforestation, further amplify this effect by disrupting ecosystems and reducing carbon absorption. Natural factors like volcanic eruptions, solar variations, and ocean currents play a smaller role but are not the main contributors to current warming. Feedback mechanisms, such as melting ice and permafrost releasing more greenhouse gases, exacerbate the issue, leading to rising temperatures, extreme weather, and ecological disruptions.</p>

                        Students can combat climate change by reducing their carbon footprint through energy conservation, using sustainable transportation, minimizing waste, and practicing the 3Rs—Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. They can participate in tree-planting initiatives, promote green spaces, and choose sustainable consumption habits like eating locally sourced, plant-based foods. Educating peers, raising awareness in schools and communities, and advocating for climate-friendly policies amplify their impact. Joining climate action groups, engaging in environmental campaigns, and studying innovative solutions like renewable energy and sustainable technologies empower students to be agents of change and inspire collective action for a sustainable future.</p>

                    <p>
                        Climate change has caused the Earth’s average temperature to rise by 1.2°C since the 19th century, driven by increasing greenhouse gas emissions, with atmospheric CO₂ levels now exceeding 420 ppm. This has led to melting polar ice, rising sea levels, and more frequent extreme weather events like hurricanes, floods, and droughts. Oceans, absorbing 90% of the excess heat and a third of CO₂, are warming and acidifying, threatening marine ecosystems. Deforestation, responsible for about 10% of global emissions, reduces the planet’s capacity to absorb carbon, while biodiversity loss and habitat changes accelerate species extinction. Energy production, primarily from fossil fuels, accounts for 73% of global emissions, jeopardizing food security and disproportionately impacting developing nations, which are least responsible yet most vulnerable to climate change.</p>
